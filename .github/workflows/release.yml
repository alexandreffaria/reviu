            This release was automatically built using GitHub Actions.
            
            **Note for Windows users:** If your antivirus flags the executable, this is due to the Rod browser automation library.
            You can run the application with the environment variable `ROD_LEAKLESS=false` to avoid this issue:
            ```
            set ROD_LEAKLESS=false
            ./capes-search.exe -search "your search term"
            ```
